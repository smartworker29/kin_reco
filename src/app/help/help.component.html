        <h3 class="heading">What is Kin?</h3>
          <p>Kin is an assistant for parents to discover and plan family-friendly experiences. We aggregate information about local events, places, camps, classes and so on that parents are always on the lookout for. We enrich the information with parent relevant data not easily found elsewhere. We then personalize our recommendations based on interests, location, age groups and social feedback. With a few simple steps we also make it easy for parents to plan play dates, get-togethers and camps/classes scheduling with friends. </p>
        
        <h3 class="heading">Which cities does Kin cover?</h3>
          <p>Kin is in beta. It is currently available only in and around Silicon Valley (roughly from San Jose to Palo Alto). We would like to get initial feedback and hone our offerings before we take on the world! Thank you for your patience. Please mail us at contact@kinparenting.com to get notified when we expand to your city.</p>
